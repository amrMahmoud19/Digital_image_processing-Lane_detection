#  Lane Detection Project##  How to compile and run codeMake sure that the following libraries are installed on your machine:   - **Matplotlib**   - **OpenCV**   - **Numpy**To check what libraries are installed on your machine, run the following command: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***pip list***if any of these libraries is not installed, open the cmd on windows or terminal on linux and run the following commands- **pip install Matplotlib**- **pip install opencv--python**- **pip install numpy**    To run code either run the bat file or open cmd/terminal on your machine and type the following command:- **python Phase1.py {input_video_path} {output_video_path} {debug} {video_mode}**	- **input\_video_path** : Path to video you want to apply pipeline on	- **output\_video_path** : Path where output video should be saved	- **debug** : 1 if you want to see steps of pipeline, 0 for the final result only
